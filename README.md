# My Portfolio

This project is my personal portfolio designed with a minimalist layout to reflect an image about me. I showcased some of my previous works in it and listed the programming skills I've learned. This website was built using `Next.js` and `Tailwind CSS`.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash

npm i
# then 
npm run dev

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses `next/font` to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
